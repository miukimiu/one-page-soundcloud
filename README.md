# onepagesoundcloud

As a **Soundcloud** lover, I allways wanted to create a single page with custom players. 
There are now many great resources in order do achieve that. After some research I found Pangular, an AngularJS Plugin that allows to create custom *Soundcloud* players in an easy way.
With some html and CSS/SASS the result was an one page site.

You can see it in action, here:
